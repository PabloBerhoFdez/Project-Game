# Project-Game
## **Introduction**
On this repository you can find my first project of Ironhack... Yes! A videogame!<br/>
For this project I used Javascript with mainly Canvas and a little bit of DOM manipulation!<br/>
This project is based on the famous anime "My Hero Academia". Your focus will be jumping over the enemies unless you want to be defeated by the villains...
## **Controls**
- *Start Game*: You'll need to press this button to start the game. Villains will start coming to defeate you... Be careful and jump with the 'ArrowUp' on your keyboard.
- *Speed Up / Speed Down*: Increases or decreases the velocity of the villains (if you're an expert playing videogames, speed up and try your best benchmark jeje).
- *Sound On / Sound Off*: This buttons are for turning off or on the music.
## **Setup**
To play this videogame you only need to open the following link: [Enjoy and defeate the villains](https://pabloberhofdez.github.io/Project-Game/)!<br/>
